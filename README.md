**Malaria Shield**

**Description:**
Malaria Shield is a concept demonstration app developed for final year engineering projects. It serves as a malaria tracking application utilizing user location data to track active patients, aiming to enhance control over the spread of malaria. Built using Flutter, the app incorporates Google Maps for location services and Firebase for user authentication and data storage.

**Project Impact in Combatting Malaria in South Asia:**
Malaria remains a significant public health concern in many parts of the world, particularly in regions like South Asia. The region faces challenges in effectively tracking and controlling the spread of the disease due to various factors including limited resources and infrastructure. Malaria Shield addresses these challenges by leveraging technology to provide real-time tracking of active malaria cases.

By utilizing user location data, Malaria Shield enables health authorities to identify areas with high malaria prevalence, allowing for targeted interventions such as mosquito control measures and distribution of anti-malarial medications. Additionally, the app facilitates communication between healthcare providers and affected individuals, ensuring timely access to treatment and healthcare services.

Through its innovative approach, Malaria Shield aims to make a tangible impact in combatting malaria in South Asia by:

- Improving the accuracy and efficiency of malaria tracking efforts.
- Enabling proactive measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
- Facilitating timely access to healthcare services for affected individuals.
- Empowering communities and healthcare authorities in the fight against malaria.
